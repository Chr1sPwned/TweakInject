This TweakInject.xm strips fishhook & replaces it with Substitute's methods

-**NOTE**-

- Currently this should work on remounted & rootless jb's
- Anyone can use this freely, I just ask you give proper credit if you do decide to use this

This is for the xSpiral (A12) Jailbreak

xSpiral is opensourced with multiple repos and can be found here - www.github.com/xSpiral

**THIS IS A WIP AND WILL BE IMPROVED ON**

I highly ask that users do not use this atm. This is currently only for devs

If you want to contact me about TweakInject.xm or anything else, shoot me a DM on twitter (@Chr1sPwn3d) or discord (Chr1sPwn3d#9333)

**CURRENT PROGRESS**
- Adding rootless support for xSpiral (**DONE**)
